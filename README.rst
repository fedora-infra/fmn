`fmn <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fmn>`_ is a family of systems to manage
end-user notifications triggered by
`fedmsg, the Fedora FEDerated MESsage bus <http://fedmsg.com>`_.

This module contains the frontend web application for Fedora Notifications.

There is a parental placeholder repo with some useful information you might
want to read through, like an `overview
<https://github.com/fedora-infra/fmn/#fedora-notifications>`_, a little
`architecture diagram <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fmn/#architecture>`_,
and some `development instructions
<https://github.com/fedora-infra/fmn/#hacking>`_ to help you get set up and
coding.
